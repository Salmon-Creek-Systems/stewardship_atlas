# Ho-to: Show/Hide Layers
#scs #atlas
In the live web map view, it is possible change what labels and layers you can see. In the legend for the map, usually near the lower left corner, you will see a checkbox next to each layer. This will allow you customize what’s shown on your map. 

Note this has no impact on what layers are shown in static/printed versions, like the RunBook, Gazetteer, and GeoPDF outputs.
