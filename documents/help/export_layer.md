#scs #atlas
Exporting a layer allows you to work on it in other software or incorporate it in other maps and datasets. If you’d like to export more than a single layer, look into “Export Atlas as GeoPKG”.

* Go to the Admin page
* Find the Layer you’re interested in on the right hand side”Layer Operations” panel.
* Click the Layer name.
  * Raster layers will download as TIFF
  * Vector layers will download as GeoJSON
* Select “Save As…” or “Allow Download” if prompted.
* The file will be named “LAYERNAME_TIMESTAMP.EXTENSION” where
  * LAYERNAME is just that
  * TIMESTAMP is the date the layer was generated or last modified 
  * EXTENSION is the filetype as above.
