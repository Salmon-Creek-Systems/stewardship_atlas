# Add to a vector layer


## Drawing Features directly on to an Existing Layer

* Follow a sidebar link to the [admin page](/outlets/html/admin)
* Find the layer you’d like to add to from the “layer operations” panel on the right - for example “roads” or “creeks”
* Click “draw” on the line for that layer
* You will now see a live map of the fire atlas.
* Zoom to the area you want to work on.
* Draw your new features
* In the controls panel at upper right:
  * set any Properties for your new Feature
  * Click "Reset" to clear all drawing you've done since last save
  * Clcik "Save" to store current state of Features you've drawn into the layer.
 
## Drawing Paths
For drawing Paths (aka "LineStrings", think roads and creeks):
* click once to start drawing.
* Move mouse to next "turn" or "control point" of the path you're drawing.
  * If you don't move very far, the App will think you're ending the path.
  * Zoom in if needed to draw close together points without ending the path.
  * Click again on the last point if you want to end the path you've drawn.
* Draw as meny paths as you want, but they will all be part of a single Feature.
  * They will all have the same Properties - so don't draw multiple roads you'll want to have different names, for example.
  * Labels will tend to go with paths

## Drawing Polygons and Areas
* draw a path as above enclosing a region
* no holes
* click on first point when finished
* hit 'escape' key to get out of drawing mode if needed

## Drawing Points and Labels
* Draw sets of points that will all have the same Properties
* Consider importing points as Lat/Long using the field in the Control Panel
